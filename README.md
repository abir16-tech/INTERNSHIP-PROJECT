# PRODUCT PRICE SCRAPING AND ANALYSIS

## E-Commerce Price Scout: Proof-of-Concept for Competitive Analysis

This mini-project serves as a practical demonstration of the core capabilities developed during the internship on **Product Price Scraping and Analysis**. The script simulates the end-to-end workflow of extracting, cleaning, storing, and analyzing real-time product pricing data from multiple e-commerce sources.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal is to showcase the automated process of competitive price monitoring:

* **Scraping:** Extracting product price and rating data from simulated external e-commerce platforms.
* **Analysis:** Comparing prices to identify the best market rate (actionable market intelligence).
* **Storage:** Transforming and storing the structured data for efficient retrieval.
